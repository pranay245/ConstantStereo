# ConstantStereo
This python program uses a camera to detect a person's face and automatically adjusts the left and right stereo outputs of speakers to create a centered stereo effect.
Make sure you have pygame and openCV installed
keep all the attached files in the same directory
the audio file must be of .wav format
inbuilt cameras work best
